# VarBayes
An applied Bayesian framework for the ACMG/AMP criteria

## Purpose
Applying the ACMG/AMP criteria often is tedious, manual and subject to human error. VarBayes provides automated application of pathogenic and benign ACMG/AMP evidence codes to all variant records in a given VCF file. VarBayes then uses these evidence codes to assign a Bayesian posterior probability of pathogenicity (0 to 1 scale), according to [Tavtigian et al, 2018](https://www.nature.com/articles/gim2017210), for downstream filtering and variant review. VarBayes dramatically reduces the number of variants for consideration in Mendelian disease studies and is capable of correctly prioritizing the diagnostic variant in whole exome and whole genome sequencing data.
